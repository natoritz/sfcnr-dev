<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![SF-CNR][sf-cnr]](https://sfcnr.com)

San Fierro Cops And Robbers begun in late 2012 of December as a basic incomplete cops and robbers server that took 
the SA-MP community by being unique - for example, being the first Cops And Robber server to allow Deathmatch.

For over half a decade, San Fierro Cops And Robbers has been supported by thousands of players and has established
a childhood memory for many.
